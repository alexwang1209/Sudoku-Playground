# Sudoku-Playground

Originally I was just going to write a simple Sudoku solver algorithm for leetcode using backtracking and the heuristic of filling in the cell with the most constraints or least options. This heuristic intuitively seems to make the algorithm faster, but then I felt the need to find a combinatoric proof of whether this indeed lowers the expected number of searches needed to solve a Sudoku puzzle. I have not found a mathematical proof yet, which left me to settle with a statistical proof. This led me down the rabbithole of coming up with an efficient Sudoku puzzle generation algorithm and other random statistics about Sudoku that I am curious about. This repository will be a playground for Sudoku where I can do my own testing.
